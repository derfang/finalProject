# Final Project of the course "Advanced Programming in C++"

here is a link to the project discription:
https://quera.org/problemset/123805?tab=description

## Additional features:

- [x] Added command line arguments : `--help` or `-h` to show help message and `--version` or `-v` to show version of the program.
- [x] Added a `Makefile` to build the program.
- [x] Handled some of invalid inputs that were not mentioned in the project description.
- [x] Added a `README.md` file to the project.

## Final note

- I tried to be loyal to the project description so any additional features that I added wont affect the main program.
